# Curax

[CurateND](https://curate.nd.edu) on [Hyrax](http://github.com/samvera/hyrax/). RAWR!

## Getting Started (a work in progress)

*Please note, these are incomplete notes but move things a bit further along.*

* Clone the repository (e.g. `git clone https://github.com/ndlib/curax.git`)
* Run `bundle install`
* Run `bundle exec rake db:create db:migrate`
* Start up a Rails server

### TODO

* Containerize the various environments and document how to use those
* How to connect to a SOLR instance
* How to connect to a Fedora instance
* You'll need to install postgresql (`brew install postgres`)
